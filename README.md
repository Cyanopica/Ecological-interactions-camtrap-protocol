This repository contains the details and associated code for the document: _Protocols for recording animal-plant interactions data with camera traps: an AI-based workflow_.

## Summary
You can use this repository as a guide for processing large numbers of video-file sets generated during camera trap surveys for monitoring animal-plant interactions (i.e., visits of animal frugivores to fruiting plants). We combine a camera trap field protocol (preprocessing) with several tools for time-saving processing (and post processing). This workflow aids to manage camera traps in the field, transfer and store data to the lab and post-process large video files batches, reducing effort and time in the database compilation. The method combines a field protocol based on camera trap operation and data standards together with Artificial Intelligence for image recognition and a viewer interface to visualize and tag images. The main objective is to build an accurate and fully annotated dataset for animal-plant interactions records while time effort is minimised.
